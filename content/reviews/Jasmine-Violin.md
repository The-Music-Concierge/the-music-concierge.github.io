Dear Jasmine,
We sincerely wish to express the gratitude we feel for the very professional performance that you gave at the social gathering  following the funeral Service for Clive.
Your beautiful violin solo performance created a  relaxed, calming and soothing ambience within the setting and contributed so much to our celebration of  Cliveâ€™s life that day.  Your own choice of tunes together with our personal requests were uplifting choices which yet again helped to make the day extra special and celebratory which was exactly what we needed and Clive would have wanted.  
We would highly recommend you to anyone who might request your performance for a special occasion.
You are a very talented young musician and we wish you every success with your studies and in your future career.
Thank you so very much,
Mary Collis , Paul Collis and Lisa Bosworth
