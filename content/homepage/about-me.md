We are a small, bespoke collective of highly trained musicians, specialising in providing a personalised, all-in-one booking service for live music at your event. Think a string quartet to walk you down the aisle, and a band to keep you and your guests dancing throughout the night. 

Book with us, and you will save on multiple booking fees and administration headaches, but youâ€™ll also know exactly who you are booking - their credentials, creative influences and more. We offer a highly tailored service and will work extensively with you to choose your lineup of musicians, instruments and songs.  

We believe that music can bring people together and create special moments. That's why we strive to provide our clients with the highest quality musical experience. We are dedicated to providing our clients with the perfect music for their event, whether it's a wedding, a corporate event, or a private party.

We are confident that we can provide you with the perfect musical experience for your event. We would love to hear from you and discuss your needs.
